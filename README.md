### For running a Node.js project:

#### Prerequisites:
- Node.js installed on your machine.

#### Instructions:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
3. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
4. Check if there is a `.env` file in the root directory. If not, create one and add your secrets.
5. Run `npm run dev` to start the server.
6. The server will start on the port specified in the `.env` file.

#### Note:
- If you need to modify environment variables, do so in the `.env` file.

### For running a React project:

#### Prerequisites:
- Node.js installed on your machine.

#### Instructions:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
3. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
4. Once the installation is complete, run `npm start` to start the development server.
5. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` (or another port if specified).

#### For Production Build:
- If you want to build the project for production, run `npm run build`. This will create a build folder with optimized production-ready code.

#### Note:
- Make sure the API endpoints in the React project match the endpoints of your Node.js server if applicable.
